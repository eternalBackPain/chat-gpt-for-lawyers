# RegEx Generator

Using OpenAi to create a React and Nextjs app that generates RegEx expressions based off a natural language description of what you would like to match.

Deployed on Vercel here: https://regex-generator-teal.vercel.app/

TODO:
- SEO optimisation (try and get this to be discoverable on a google search)
- launch to prod with a unique domain (find out what the pricing on this stuff is)

To run locally:
1. clone repo
2. npm install
3. create .env file and add API key
